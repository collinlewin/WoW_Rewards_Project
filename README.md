# World of Warcraft Rewards Project
For well over a decade, World of Warcraft has sustained my excitement over thousands of hours of collecting mounts, progressing in raids, making friends, and becoming the best professionist I can be. In this project, I will walk through my throught process behind designing and implementing new rewards systems for Azeroth and beyond. We will first explore areas of the game in which rewards can be introduced, catering to various types of players. Some of these ideas will be fleshed out more than others and include statistical modeling to inform implementation.

Yee (2006) proposed that there are three main types of gamers, each with various subtypes: achievement (advancement, mechanics, competition), social (socializing, relationship, teamwork) and immersion (discovery, role-playing, customization, escapism). While players often fall into multiple groups, I found brainstorming rewards to enhance these different player groups to be an interesting starting point. 
- An alternative, more-optimal starting point would be data-driven. Where are players spending the most time, and how does retention compare for players who prefer pet battles versus raiding versus professions? How do these statistics compare to previous expansions/systems?

I first considered new rewards that would incentivize gameplay that the social gamers would enjoy. PvE and PvP excel in this department, more often than not requiring teamwork to succeed in mythics, battlegrounds, and arenas.
